## Explanation of Array Methods

- `push()` and `pop()`: Add/remove elements at the end of an array.
- `shift()` and `unshift()`: Add/remove elements at the beginning.
- `forEach()`: Iterates over each element without creating a new array.
- `map()`: Transforms each element and returns a new array.
- `filter()`: Returns a new array with elements that meet a specific condition.
- `reduce()`: Reduces the array to a single value by accumulating results.
- `find()`: Finds the first element that meets a condition.
- `indexOf()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in the array. If the element is not found, it returns -1.
- `some()` and `every()`: Check if at least one or all elements meet a condition.
- `includes()`: Checks if an element exists in the array.
